# PSoC&trade; 4: AI-based Written Digits Recognition

This demo showcases the execution of a neural network able to detect digits from 0 to 9 written with a finger on the CAPSENSE&trade; Touchpad using Infineon PSoC&trade; 4 MCU to carry out the computation.
PSoC 4 is a 32-bit MCU with a 48-MHz Arm® Cortex®-M0+ CPU, 384KB flash and 32KB SRAM available. The constraints given by the available memory and computational power frame this demo in the tinyML subfield of artificial intelligence.
This is a fully functional example with an accuracy of more than 98%, making it suitable to be used as a basis for further improvement until a production quality level is reached.

A Graphical User Interface shows in real time the drawing made on the capacitive shield and provides the neural network output in a visual and eye-catching manner.

This code example also delivers the TensorFlowLite Micro library compiled for PSoC4.

## Hardware setup

Connect the PSoC&trade; 4 SMAX board to the CAPSENSE&trade; sensing expansion board by using the ribbon cable included in the package. Use the 40-pin connector on the CAPSENSE&trade; sensing expansion board called "TOUCHPAD FLEX CONNECTOR" as shown in figure:

![Connection ](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/img/connected_board.jpeg)


**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 4 kits ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software setup

Paste the folder "Written-Digist-Recognition-PSoC4" in you ModusToolbox&trade; workspace.

This demo application uses a GUI to show the drawing in real time and to plot the neural network's inference results. The GUI needs to be configured to listen to the correct serial port. To perform the configuration, navigate to Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/GUI and open "serial.conf" file. Edit it according to the serial port assigned to your kit on your PC. Save the file.

```
[SERIAL]
port = COM5

```

This example requires no additional software or tools.

In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software:

1. Click the **Import Existing Application In-Place** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**).

2. Select the "Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4" folder in your workspace from the **Import ModusToolbox Project** dialog.

3. Click **Finish** and wait for the application import process to complete.

4. In the ModusToolbox&trade; console, run the command `make getlibs` and wait for the execution to be completed.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>


3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Navigate to the folder `Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/GUI` and run the **realtime-gui.exe** program by double-clicking it. A terminal window will open and after 10 seconds, the GUI will be displayed.

   **Figure 1. GUI displayed.**

   ![GUI startup](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/img/gui-startup.jpeg)

4. By keeping the kit oriented vertically, with the USB connector on the upper side and the CAPSENSE&trade; shield near you, use your finger to write a single digit from 0 to 9 on the CAPSENSE&trade; touchpad.
Write the number by trying to exploit the full surface of the shield as shown in the following image:

   **Figure 2. Correct drawing orientation.**
   
   ![Drawing example](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/img/drawing_example.jpg)

   You will see the GUI showing your drawing in real time on the `Raw CAPSENSE Output` window: 

   **Figure 3. Real-time drawing being shown.**
   
   ![Drawing realtime](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/img/gui-realtime-drawing.jpg)

   When your drawing is complete, simply lift your finger from the touchpad.

6. The neural network will be triggered after 1 second without touch activity. Raw input will be preprocessed and fed into the neural network. The execution will return the confidence value for each digit, and the highest one will be selected as predicted digit:

   **Figure 4. Neural network inference results displayed.**
   
   ![output](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/img/gui-output.jpg)

8. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with different digits. The system can tolerate rotations and rescaling of the written digits up to a certain amount. Highest accuracy is obtained when digits are written by exploiting the full surface and keeping the orientation of the board as described above.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The example is composed by three core components:

1. Firmware responsible for capturing CAPSENSE input and preprocessing
2. TensorFlow Lite Micro library compiled for PSoC4
3. Neural network for performing digits classification


### Firmware block scheme

The firmware has been designed according to the following block scheme. A .pdf file is provided in the  `doc` folder.

![firmware blocks](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/doc/WDR-PSoC4.png)

The main loop of the application keeps waiting for input data to be ready. If no data is available yet, the CAPSENSE scan loop is executed, where the touchpad waits until a finger is detected. When a finger is detected for the first time, touch coordinates are read and saved in an optimized data structure to keep track of the drawing. When the finger is lift, a timer counts until one second of time is elapsed. If the user keeps drawing, the timer is stopped and will be resumed when the finger will be lift again. Once the timer expires, the "acquired_data" flag is set to True to indicate that the user has finished the drawing. The data is then preprocessed (it is downscaled to match the expected input size for the neural network), and the "data_ready" flag is set to True. 

When the main loop detects the "data_ready" flag to be true, the neural network is called to perform inference on the data. Flags are resetted to prepare for another acquisition.


### TFLM Library porting

To achieve the execution of neural networks on PSoC4, a manual porting of the TensorFlow Lite Micro library has been performed. The library source code is contained in the  `tflm-cmsis` folder. It can be ported on another PSoC4 equipped board by taking care of including the compiler flags set on the Makefile, since they are required for the correct compilation.

### Neural network design

The neural network has been designed specifically by taking into account the constraints of the target device, by applying Tiny-ML oriented design techniques. The optimal architecture has been chosen among differet models of increasing complexity trained on the [MNIST public dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The model is a standard Convolutional Neural Network with the following architecture:

![Model](Written-Digits-Recognition-PSoC4/img/model.jpg)

The model has a total of 5114 parameters.

After training the neural network on the MNIST dataset, a fine-tuning of the model has been performed on a custom dataset collected directly from the CAPSENSE&trade; touchpad.
Fine-tuning training ended with the following loss and accuracy values:

```
Epoch 456/1000
25/25 - 0s - loss: 0.0772 - accuracy: 0.9800 - val_loss: 0.0341 - val_accuracy: 0.9900 - 168ms/epoch - 7ms/step
```

And a testing on a portion of data collected from CAPSENSE&trade; shield showed perfect classification:

```
4/4 [==============================] - 0s 7ms/step - loss: 0.0225 - accuracy: 1.0000

Test accuracy: 100.0%
```

The model has been quantized at 8-bit depth to reduce its size and exported in .cc by using TensorFlow Lite Micro.
The final model requires 5KB of Flash memory to be stored.
